# LoCap Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how LoCap collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you use our mobile application (the "LoCap").

### Information We Collect

- **Camera:** The App requires permission to access your device's camera. We use the camera to allow you to take a picture which is mandatory when creating a chat room.
- **Location:** The App requires permission to access your device's location. This allows us to:
    - Display nearby chat rooms.
    - Show your location on a map for better context within the App.

### Use of Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
- To provide the core functionalities of the App: We use your location data to display nearby chat rooms relevant to your surroundings.
- To enhance your experience: We use your location to show your position on the map, helping you connect with nearby users in chat rooms.
- A picture is required when creating a chat room to visually represent the room and provide better context for users.

### Sharing of Information

We will not share your information with any third party without your consent. However, this excludes the following:
- **Location Services:** We may use third-party location services, such as Google Maps API, to provide location-based features. Your location data may be subject to their privacy policy. It's recommended to review their policy [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).

### Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet or electronic storage system is 100% secure.

### Your Choices

You can control your location privacy settings within the App. However, disabling location services will limit your ability to see nearby chat rooms and show your location on the map. Disabling camera access will prevent you from creating chat rooms altogether.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the App.
